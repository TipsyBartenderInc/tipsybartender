		<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
		<p>
			This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how
			their ‘Personally Identifiable Information’ (“PII”) is being used online or with mobile applications. PII,
			as described in U.S. Privacy Law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or
			with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in
			context. Please read our Privacy Policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use,
			protect or otherwise handle your PII in accordance with our website and mobile app. We may amend or change
			this Privacy Policy from time to time and without prior notice to you. If we make changes in the way we
			collect or use information, we will notify visitors by posting an announcement on the website. Your
			continued use of the website and/or mobile app after an update to the Privacy Policy is published or
			otherwise communicated to you shall constitute your consent to the changes. Otherwise, you should not
			continue accessing the website or app. This policy is effective as of January, 22 2018.</p>

		<br />

		<h4>What personal information do we collect from the people that visit our blog, website or app?</h4>
		<p>There is very little information needed from you to set up an account with us. We may ask for additional
			information from time to time but whether you give that information will be voluntary. We may collect the
			following information:</p>

		<p>• General account information, such as name, job title, and submitted images<br />
			• Contact information including email address<br />
			• Demographic information such as zip code, preferences and interests<br />
			• Other information that is relevant to the use of our site, such as activity, duration of use and
			interaction with customer service.</p>

		<br />

		<h4>When do we collect information?</h4>

		<p>We collect information from you when you volunteer it by subscribing to our website or uploading (or
			entering) information on our site.</p>

		<br />

		<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>

		<p>We may use the information we collect from you to provide a better service. Some of the specific reasons
			include:<br /><br />

			• Internal record keeping<br />
			• To improve and develop our services, such as for technical support.<br />
			• We may use the information to customize the website according to your interests.<br />
			• We may use your information to promote safety and security
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>How do we protect your information?</h4>

		<p>
			We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access or
			disclosure we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to safeguard and
			secure the information we collect online.<br /><br />

			Please note that no website can guarantee absolute security of data. We cannot guarantee or warrant the
			security of information you disclose or transmit to and through our website and cannot be responsible for
			the theft, destruction, or inadvertent disclosure of information. We highly recommend that visitors keep
			their computers secure.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Do we use ‘cookies’?</h4>

		<p>
			A cookie is a small file that asks permission to be placed on your computer’s hard drive. Once you agree,
			the file is added, and the cookie helps analyze web traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular
			site. Cookies allow web applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor its
			operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering information about your
			preferences.<br /><br />

			We use third-party advertising companies to serve ads when you visit our Web site. These companies may use
			information (not including your name, address, email address or telephone number) about your visits to this
			and other Web sites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. If you
			would like more information about this practice and to know your choices about not having this information
			used by these companies, click here.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Third-party disclosure</h4>

		<p>
			We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your PII unless we provide users with
			advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating
			our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this
			information confidential. We may also release information when its release is appropriate to comply with the
			law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety. However,
			non-personally identifiable visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising,
			or other uses.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Third-party links</h4>

		<p>
			Our website may contain links to enable you to visit other websites of interest easily. However, once you
			have used these links to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over that other
			website. Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information that you
			provide while visiting such sites, and this privacy policy does not govern such sites. Since we do not
			control the privacy policies of any third party, you should investigate its policy before you disclose your
			personal information to them.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Google</h4>

		<p>
			Google’s advertising requirements can be summed up by Google’s Advertising Principles. They are put in place
			to provide a positive experience for users.<br /><br />

			We may use Google AdSense Advertising on our website. Google, as a third-party vendor, uses cookies to serve
			ads on our site. Google’s use of the DART cookie enables it to serve ads to our users based on previous
			visits to our site and other sites on the Internet. Users may opt-out of the use of the DART cookie by
			visiting the Google Ad and Content Network privacy policy. We, along with third-party vendors such as Google
			use first-party cookies (such as the Google Analytics cookies) and third-party cookies (such as the
			DoubleClick cookie) or other third-party identifiers together to compile data regarding user interactions
			with ad impressions and other ad service functions as they relate to our website.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Opting out</h4>

		<p>
			Users can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the Google Ad Settings page. Alternatively,
			you can opt out by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative Opt Out page or by using the Google Analytics
			Opt Out Browser add on.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>

		<p>
			CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a
			privacy policy. The laws reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
			United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting PII from California consumers to
			post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those
			individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.<br /><br />

			See more at:<br /><br />

			<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf">http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</a><br /><br />

			California residents using the site are entitled to know that they may file grievances and complaints with
			the California Department of Consumer Affairs, 400 R Street, Suite 1080, Sacramento, CA 95814, by phone at
			916-445-1254 or 800-952-5210, or by email to dca@dca.ca.gov.<br /><br />

			According to CalOPPA, we agree to users visiting our site anonymously.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h4>

		<p>
			We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT)
			browser mechanism is in place.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>

		<p>
			Our website is for adults. When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the
			age of 13 years old, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The
			Federal Trade Commission, United States’ consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
			out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children’s privacy and safety
			online.<br /><br />

			We do not market to children. If we discover we have received any information from a person who is under the
			age of majority in violation of the law, we will delete that information immediately. If you believe that we
			have any information from or about anyone under the age of majority, please contact us immediately.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>Fair Information Practices</h4>

		<p>
			The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the
			concepts they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
			globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical
			to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information. In order to be in line with Fair
			Information Practices we will notify you via email within 1 business day.
		</p>

		<br />

		<h4>CAN SPAM Act</h4>

		<p>
			The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial
			messages, gives recipients the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
			penalties for violations. We do not expect to collect or send out emails, but if we decide to do so we will
			comply with the CAN-SPAM Act, which includes:<br /><br />

			• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.<br />
			• Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.<br />
			• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.<br />
			• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.<br />
			• Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.<br />
			• Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.<br />
			If at any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, you can email us at
			and we will promptly remove you from ALL correspondence.
